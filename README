== Langston's Ant

A classic simulation of life and evolution.  I use the example for a Ruby Kata.

The Ant has been implemented dozens of times as a kata.  The remains of the many of the solutions can be found in

	./old
	
== Running the Simulation

This is a Limelight production.  Assuming you have the Limelight gem installed you can run the simulation like so:

	jruby -S limelight open langston-s-ant
	
If you have Limelight installed as an application, then choose the langston-s-ant directory when using the open menu option.
